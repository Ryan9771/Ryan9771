## About Me
I am Ryan! A current computing undergraduate at imperial college london. I enjoy learning new things, and applying these to practical applications. Hence, I love to take on new projects. (Note: A new personal fully responsive website is almost completed, and should replace the current website by the end of the year!)

## Some things I know / am learning:
Haskell, C, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, Scala, HTML, CSS, React-native, OpenCV, Flask, Webscraping - Request, Selenium, etc!
